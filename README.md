# Balloon-Popper-Game
OpenGL game
The balloons are generated at random X positions and start rising up towards the sky (20 balloons are generated)
The user should click on a balloon while it is rising to pop it:
For red balloon, the score increases by 1
For yellow balloon, the score increases by 2
If the balloon hits the ceiling, score decreases by 1 as penalty, and balloon starts falling to the ground
At this point, the user can no longer pop the balloon with the mouse
The user can only move the basket to save falling balloons
For each balloon saved, the score increases by 1
There is a time limit of 20 seconds, after which the "Time's Up" screen is displayed with the user's final score
The user can press on F1 to restart the game
